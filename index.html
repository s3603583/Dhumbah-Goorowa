            <h3>Eric Kuang</h3>
            <p>s3603583. My Interest in IT has always been a closet interest. Over my childhood I’ve always had an interest in computers. I picked up information technology in highschool when I was in grade 10 however after graduation from highschool I decided an alternative pathway choosing Civil Engineering. I shortly found out I had no passion for physics and decided to change to Business (management) which I also had no interest for. After going on a gap year finding out what I wanted to do, I decided to go back to university and chose IT since I’ve always had a passion for Information Technology. My hobbies include travelling, music festivals and volleyball. </p>

            <p>Theophilo Serur, s3796563, Brazilian Business graduate now going for a third degree. What really sparked my interest in IT was my business background. It is surprising how some outdated practices persist today.I have always been <em>The guy</em> to deal with technology at work, and felt strongly that most traditional businesses could greatly benefit from proper IT development.</p>

            <h3>Ethan Nichoals</h3>
            <p>My interest in IT is a rather new one only really coming to light last year. I had always been interested in gaming and game making since it is a rather creative and fun thing to do. Being able to create your own world that can be interacted with and providing that kind of experience to others really appealed to me, however confronted with the fact it was competitive and not strong at all in the Aus I never really considered it a real option.  Since finding out I didn’t like science anymore as a result of just doing it too much made me realise however that I should just try and do the things I want to, so for the first time, really considered doing IT. <br>‍<br>‍</p>

I have completed my VCE and sucessfully completed my Diploma of Business at RMIT and now currently studying IT at RMIT. In my free times i&#x27;m normally play video games or surfing the net.

            <h3>Bilal Rizvi</h3>
            <p>s3719179. I have a Sri-Lankan background and was born and raised in Australia. My hobbies include playing games and watching T.V. shows. I have had a deep interest in IT ever since childhood, when I would watch my Dad fix computers in the living room. I remember watching him intently, constantly asking him for the play-by-play of what he was doing. This experience birthed in me a love for all things science and technology. From my first email address to my first phone I was always blown away with the new piece of technology I got to play with. Due to this childhood experience, I was always fairly well versed with IT and was always the IT guy that would fix things in the house or at school. I do enjoy the hardware side of tech a little bit more than the software side and thus am always updated on the new PC hardware or gadget that comes out.</p>

              <h2><br>Project Idea</h2>
              <p>The project is an auto scroller platform game. Our main character is an Australian pizza trying to avoid being topped with pineapples. Its mechanics is based on games such as Jetpack Joyride, Temple Run or even the Google web browser game that appears when no internet is available. The biggest difference is that it has some background story and an ending.<br><br>Starting in Melbourne CBD, our protagonist will have to dodge numerous obstacles such as bogans, kangaroos and the dreaded pineapples. From the CBD, the scenery will change to the bush and finally outbacks, where a smugglers plane will take our hero safely to Italy where he will enjoy leisure time next to mozarelas and pepperonis.This idea was born from two things: pizza in class and a random word: pineapple. The reason for choosing this is that it is a relatively simple project, and might be finished before the course ends.<br></p>

              <h2><br>Test Outcomes</h2>
              <p>From these results that we have gathered from our personality tests, It can be seen that we have to protagonists, a mediator and a virtuoso. With all these different type of personality types we had to make sure if they were compatible. With the protagonists being natural-born leaders, we were able to assign tasks and help the team work together in improving ourselves and improving the report. Having a Virtuoso on the team, we were able to keep a move in the project with useful building and improving on their learning. Finally, the last personality, the architect we were able to come up with useful ideas with our project with his imaginative behaviour and the protagonist to allow set that project in motion.<br><br>These tests can also help us understand how we can work together as efficiently as possible. Using these results, we can determine that most of the group is active and assertive, meaning that we can be assured that our groups individuals are able to be proactive to problems that might arise, choosing to solve them themselves. The results also show that our group, largely, learns via visual que’s, and hence much of the groups planning is drawn or set up in a diagram or brainstorm.</p>

            <p>IT is a vast area filled with many different kinds of Jobs and expertise. Our team reflects that in our choices for jobs. The Ideal jobs of our team consist of a large variety of positions, from customer service, to software development to Analytics, no two members want the same kind of area. However we all share similar reasons for taking them. <br>When choosing our pathways, we base them off personal interest, freedom, and control. Many of the jobs enable the ability to choose our own deadlines and work at our own pace, and all of them have strong availability in many places. <br>To get to our wanted work we also will to take similar routes, while we would study many different things, they all involve gaining the knowledge and capability from university, as well as finding experience in work placement, cultivating that in our entry level jobs, to them finally work our way up to our high level positions.</p>
